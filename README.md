# Inventory_App
Inventory system

Design to run on a Raspberry Pi, this program allows you to track the inventory and maintainence of equipment in a hospital. Basic functionality is present, howver it is not complete - things like authentication are still quite hacky.

Work was done locally but later pushed to git for prosperity - hence the single commit.
